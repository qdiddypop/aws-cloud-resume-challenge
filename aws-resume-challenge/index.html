Applied robust security measures, including security headers and Origin Request Policies, to protect the website. Effectively leveraged a range of AWS services and tools, showcasing comprehensive cloud skills. Additionally, created custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to manage and secure access to various AWS resources, further enhancing the project's security and access control.</p>
